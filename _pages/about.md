I am a PhD student at the CDT in NLP, University of Edinburgh advised by Prof. Martin Pickering and Dr. Yevgen Matusevych. I study bilingualism using behavioural and computational methods. I am interested in how two or more languages interact in the bilingual brain, and how this affects the comprehension and production of language.
